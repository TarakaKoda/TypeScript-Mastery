what is TypeScript?
why do we need it?
How is it different from JavaScript?

TypeScript is a programming language created by the microsoft to address shortcomings of JavaScript.

 You can think of as the brother of a javascript 
 javascript is a kid who doesn't have the discipline who does whatever he/she wants
 on the other hand we have typescript a kid with some discipline
 technically speaking typescript is a programming language built up on the javascript
 so every javascript file is a valid typescript file
 but typescript adds some cool features that help us will robust and maintainable application quickly
 Benefits:
 1. static typing
 2. code completion
 3. refactoring 
 4. shorthand notation
 1. what is static typing?
 In programming we have type of languages Statically-typed and Dynamically-type
---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
 STATICALLY_TYPED          |          DYNAMICALLY-TYPED
---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
  (c++, C#,Java)           |   (JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
                           |     let number = 10;
  int number = 10;         |     number = "a";
  number = "a"; X changing |     Math.round(number); this will be a problem
   type is not allowed     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 while in statically typed languages will check the type of the variable in the time of compiling
 in the other hand we have dynamically typed languages which will check the type of variable in the run tim
 typescript is just javascript with type checking
 Drawbacks:
 1. Complication
 2. we need to be more discipline while writing the typescript
 we can use typescript for medium and large projects and javascript for medium project
