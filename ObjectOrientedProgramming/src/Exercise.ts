// Define a class called Logger that takes the name of a file in its constructor and provides 
// a method for writing messages to that file. Donâ€™t worry about the actual file I/O 
// operations. Just define the class with the right members.

// this two are know as the access specifiers (public, private, protected)

// private: private methods and attribute are only can be accessed within the same class

// Given the data below, define an interface for representing employees: 

interface Employee1 {
